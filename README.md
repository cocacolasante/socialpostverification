SOCIAL MEDIA POST VERIFICATION

What we are:
    we are a decentralized application for uploading your media to your social media posts before you post them, to verify that your posts are yours. After uploading your media, you will receive a QR code to add to your posts. This can be used to verify that who is the original poster of the content, the time, and what the content is. All done in a decentralized permissionless way.

How we work:
    By uploading your pictures or videos, we take that content and store it in a decentralized file storage system. From there, we provide a link to that data and then mint that link to your account via a smart contract. This data is accessable to the public so anyone can go back and verify that you did or did not post something.

Why: 
    in a world of AI generated images and videos, deep fakes have become a real concern
