        Deep fakes. leaked footage. news telling us one thing, while social media tells us something different.
            These problems can affect anyone, even Joe Rogan was immitated with this technology to have his voice promote a product.
            With these rampad problems, one needs to verify their posts, in an immutable, censorship resistant way.

            Here comes SocialProof, a blockchain based social media verification platform. When minting a post to the blockchain, you will
            receive a QR code to embed in your images. This code points to our site, where one can verify that you did or did not post 
            a tweet, or a video. All verified by a trustless, tamperproof system.
